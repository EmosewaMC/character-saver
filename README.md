# lu-utility-mods
A client mod for LEGO Universe that allows users to have access to their character save data without needing to ask a server owner.

If using a mod as a standalond mod, take the file in the Standalone directory and put it in the directory that has legouniverse.exe.  Only 1 of these can exist at a time.
if using this mod in a mod loader, copy the folder for the mod(s) you want to a mods folder in the same directory as legouniverse.exe (make sure to rename the dll for the mod loaders format)
