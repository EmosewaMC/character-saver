# lu-utility-mods
A client mod for LEGO Universe that allows users to have access to their character save data without needing to ask a server owner.

The save data will be located at `%localappdata%/lego software/lego universe/<character_name>/<server_name>/CharacterSave.xml`
to get there, paste `%localappdata%/lego software/lego universe` into the explorer address bar, open the character name you want to find the save of and then open the folder for the server that save was on.

If using a mod as a standalond mod, take the file in the Standalone directory and put it in the directory that has legouniverse.exe. Only 1 of these can exist at a time. if using this mod in a mod loader, copy the folder for the mod(s) you want to a mods folder in the same directory as legouniverse.exe (make sure to rename the dll for the mod loaders format)
