# character-saver
A client mod for LEGO Universe that allows users to have access to their character save data without needing to ask a server owner.

If using the mod as a standalond mod, take the file in CharacterSaverStandalone and put it in the directory that has legouniverse.exe
if using this mod in a mod loader, copy the folder CharacterSaver to a mods folder in the same directory as legouniverse.exe (make sure to rename the dll for the mod loaders format)
